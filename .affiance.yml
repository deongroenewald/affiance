# Use this file to configure the Affiance hooks you wish to use. This will
# extend the default configuration defined in:
# https://github.com/l8on/affiance/blob/master/config/default.yml
#
# At the topmost level of this YAML file is a key representing type of hook
# being run (e.g. pre-commit, commit-msg, etc.). Within each type you can
# customize each hook, such as whether to only run it on certain files (via
# `include`), whether to only display output if it fails (via `quiet`), etc.
#
# For a complete list of hooks, see:
# https://github.com/l8on/affiance/tree/master/lib/hook
#
# For a complete list of options that you can use to customize hooks, see:
# https://github.com/l8on/affiance#configuration

# Uncomment the following lines to make the configuration take effect.
